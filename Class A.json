        "Description": "This project is an attempt to represent the mind of many women. The societal pressure, the standard on HOW to be a woman as if existing as one is not good enough. and sometimes, it can feel like we're in a sh*tshow - like a circus. People come & go to watch & leave, but we always have to give our 100% and meet different expectations every single time for everyone but ourselves.\\nAnd even when the audience isn't there, when the circus has closed, their presence have engraved in our brains."

        "Description": "My artwork is about two royals living together in a tower, similar like Rapunzel's tower. They both were rich but the king has a big obsession with the moon. He would always worship it every night without sleep. It made the wife feel unwanted and left behind. The king believed that the moon is an undefeatable God and without it human life would be meaningless and perish to its very feet. He was so devoted in which he believed he is the servant of the divine Gods. His greed and selfishness had no bounds when it comes to power. He would do anything to gain strength even if it costs ones life. One night, during his wife's slumber. He decided to throw his beloved off the tower, a noble sacrifice was necessary in his eyes to gain more power and control. But in reality, he only lost a piece of him."
