        "Description": "This artwork is created to show the two sides of \"Love\". Love, known by most, is something pure, innocent, and heartwarming. However, in the wrong hands, love could be rather cruel and toxic. As much as love can heal and give life, it could also hurt and kill, both metaphorically and literally. An ironically familiar case to this would be when parents hit their children \"out of love\" or when someone went to \"extreme lengths\" to protect their partner. Sure, it's awful, but the motive is \"love\". So, without normalizing the cruelty and toxicity, we must all agree that love comes in many different forms and the eerie part of this sculpture might just be one of them. "
